# scrow Prototype

## Overview

This prototype demonstrates the integration of **Matrix Synapse** (a decentralized messaging protocol) with a custom **Cosmos SDKâ€“based backend**. The key innovation is server-managed cryptographic keys for efficient and secure access to blockchain functionality. This prototype serves as a technical foundation and proof of concept for a larger vision: a decentralized e-commerce platform with on-chain escrow and logistics integration.

## Original Project Goal

The ultimate goal is to build a **decentralized e-commerce platform** where users can purchase products on-chain using cryptocurrency. The platform will integrate multiple logistics providers (e.g., DHL) via APIs, enabling seamless delivery management. Payments will be escrowed on-chain and released only upon confirmed delivery. A DAO or validator network will manage dispute resolution, ensuring trust and security among buyers, sellers, and logistics providers.

## Architecture & Reasoning

- **Matrix Synapse** is used for decentralized, real-time messaging and coordination between parties (buyers, sellers, logistics providers, validators).
- The **Cosmos SDK backend** manages blockchain logic such as payment escrow, order states, and dispute resolution.
- **Server-managed keys** provide a balance between security and performance by enabling efficient blockchain transaction signing without burdening end-users with complex key management.
- This prototype links real-time communication with blockchain backend operations, a critical component for seamless order and logistics coordination.

## What This Prototype Builds

- A functional bridge between Matrix Synapse messaging and Cosmos SDK blockchain backend.
- Key management handled on the server for fast and secure transaction signing.
- Basic workflows to demonstrate interaction patterns between messaging events, custom go server and blockchain state changes(to-do).

---

## Next Steps

- Expand blockchain logic to handle full escrow, order management, and dispute resolution.
- Integrate external logistics APIs for real-world delivery tracking.
- Develop user interfaces for buyers, sellers, and logistics providers.
- Transition key management toward more decentralized or user-controlled models.
